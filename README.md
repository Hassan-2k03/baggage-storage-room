# Baggage Management System

This repository contains a C implementation of a Baggage Management System using hash tables and priority queues. The system allows users to manage baggage items, their owners, and check-in times through a command-line interface.

## Files

### `main.c`

This file contains the main program that utilizes functions defined in `baggage.h` and `baggage.c` to interact with the baggage management system. It presents a menu-driven interface allowing users to insert, search, delete, and display baggage items.

### `baggage.c`

This file includes implementations of functions that perform various operations on the baggage management system. It defines functions for initializing hash tables, inserting, searching, updating, and deleting items, along with functions for validating item details and handling time-related operations.

### `baggage.h`

This header file defines structures, function prototypes, and constants used across the baggage management system. It declares structures for items, nodes in the hash table, check-in times, and priority queues. Additionally, it declares function prototypes for hash table operations, item validations, and time-related functions.

## How to Use

To use this baggage management system:

1. **Compile**: Compile the provided source files using a C compiler. For example:
   ```
   gcc main.c baggage.c -o baggage_system
   ```

2. **Run**: Execute the compiled program:
   ```
   ./baggage_system
   ```

3. **Menu Options**: Use the displayed menu options to interact with the system. You can perform actions such as inserting new baggage items, searching for items, deleting items, and displaying the contents of the baggage storage.

4. **Input Validation**: The system validates entered data such as ID, name, and phone number. Ensure that inputs adhere to the specified formats to avoid errors.

## Important Notes

- **Input Validation**: Ensure to input valid details (ID, name, phone number) following the specified formats to prevent errors during item insertion.
- **Command-Line Interface**: The system operates through a command-line interface and follows a menu-driven approach for user interaction.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements!
